Sometimes I feel like I live by numbers! There's numbers I pace myself by: _three_ daily up-times, _five_ daily sessions of complete rest. The numbers that control my diet: _three_ low GI meals a day, _one_ dairy snack a day, _two_ fish snacks a week. The numbers that govern my activities: _30_ minutes in the sun every day, _three_ exercise sessions per week, heart rate below _111_ beats per minute.

These numbers keep me as healthy as I can be, but they also encase my life in a pretty rigid shell. You'd think the last thing I'd need want was more numbers! However, last year I added a new one: include at least one fun thing every week. It's made such a difference.

For the last few weeks my 'fun thing' has been learning how to marble paper. For much of last year it was figuring out how to make [fair trade white chocolate](https://blog.puriri.nz/search/label/fair%20trade%20white%20chocolate). Sometimes it's simply playing a board game. A few weeks back it was [a trip to our local Serbian Orthodox Church's monthly bake sale](https://blog.puriri.nz/2016/04/a-short-visit-to-serbia.html). That one was particularly special and I'm so glad we went, even though it was pretty tiring. Not only did we purchase quantities of delicious food but, when I expressed an interest, the ladies there were delighted to show me around their church and explain it all to me. By the time we left, I felt like I'd had a brief visit to Serbia! It gives me such a lift to have more variety in my life.

So, this new number has become my favourite number. Making sure I do at least _one_ fun thing every week helps gives me a hope that life can be enjoyable, even though I'm very ill.
