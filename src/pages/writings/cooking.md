description: brief notes on ways to make this task less energy intensive
---
A wonderful help to me in cooking has been a slow cooker. I can prepare the food in the morning when I have a bit more energy, and then the crock pot does the rest and I don't need to do anything at dinner time. We recently purchased a book of NZ crock pot recipes and have discovered that you can do all kinds of things in a crock pot, including making lovely moist roast chicken. (To roast a chicken you simply put the stuffed bird in the crockpot and leave it cooking on low/auto for 7-9 hours. It comes out particularly moist if stuffed with a whole scored lemon with garlic and herbs or stuffed with a scored apple rather than conventional stuffing).
